## Part 1
* My design for the XML portion of the project keeps the initial conditions of the simulation hidden from the rest of the program, and only provides these details when it provides the cell array or grid to the rest of the program. 
* FileHandler class makes use of the Initializer class which is quite flexible as it can be used to determine the starting configurations of any of the simulations based solely upon the type of simulation data stored in the xml file. 
* Nearly everything will be closed as the objective of the FileHandler class is to carry out its task and deliver an object without being altered in any way by other classes.
* Quite a few exceptions will need to be handled, including: files not existing or incorrectly described, file attrbutes being null, and parsing errors. 
* I think that my design is decent and that it is made good by the fact that it can be flexibly changed between the different simulations by merely changing the file name. 

## Part 2
* My part of the project is wholely dependent upon the GUI as it is dependent upon the file name that is passed to it, and it is also linked to the other classes as it is the source of the cell array, meaning that the rest of the program is dependent upon what the output of my program is. 
* The dependency is not really dependent upon the class behavior, but it is entirely dependent upon the use behavior and the file selection system. 
* I would say that there is a way to minimize these dependencies by creating a GUI that only accepts certain file that it knows will work, thus not ever issuing a missing file. 
* The fileReader class within the FileHandler superclass could be improved by a more flexible system of deciphering than the current if tree used to decide how to build the array or grid. 

## Part 3
* 
- Store all information in an xml file into variables 
	- Create a grid for Fire
	- Create a grid for Life
	- Create a grid for Wator
	- Create a grid for Segregation
* I am most excited to work on translating the xml data into actual java variables
* I am worried about the potential inflexibility of my method for creating the data structures.
